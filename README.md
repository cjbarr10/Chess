So I'm farely new at coding and I have set my mind on making chess creating my own coded logic and try to work on design with the chess board. I'm starting off with a
simple design called ChessOfPawns. This will just contain pawns and the queen. This first version will only be able to use in the console. To continue with this, I need
to learn how to make buttons on intelliJ and how to interact with them. Once I learn this all I need to do is combine what I did in chessOfPawns to my final project finalChess.
Along the way of just learning how to interact with button. I wanna refine and simpify my code and make it more readable.
